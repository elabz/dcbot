# RFID UHF AI Machine Learning Computer Vision Project

Welcome to the **RFID UHF AI Machine Learning Computer Vision** repository! This project combines RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) technology with AI-based machine learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to create a comprehensive system that can track, identify, and analyze objects in real-time using both RFID tags and visual data.

## Overview

In many real-world applications—such as inventory management, asset tracking, and automated inspection—combining RFID and computer vision can greatly improve object identification and tracking accuracy. This repository showcases a prototype system that:
- Uses an **RFID UHF reader** to detect the presence of tags within range.
- Employs **AI/ML models** to classify or detect objects in camera feeds.
- Integrates both data streams to provide real-time, reliable identification and location information.

---

## Features

- **RFID Tag Integration**  
  Communicates with RFID UHF readers to detect and read tag IDs.

- **Computer Vision**  
  Leverages object detection, classification, or segmentation models (e.g., YOLO, TensorFlow, OpenCV-based pipelines) to visually identify objects.

- **Data Fusion**  
  Combines RFID readings with vision-based detections for more robust object tracking.

- **Firmware Control**  
  Low-level C/C++ firmware to control and manage the RFID reader hardware, sensor inputs, and microcontroller configurations.

- **Modular Software Architecture**  
  Python/C++/other high-level environment that hosts the machine learning and data fusion logic.

- **Scalable**  
  Extensible to include other sensors or different AI models.

---

## Hardware Requirements

1. **RFID UHF Reader Module**  
   - (e.g., an Impinj R2000-based reader or similar)  
   - With antennas suitable for the intended range and environment.

2. **Microcontroller / Development Board**  
   - For example, ESP32, STM32, or Arduino-based boards with sufficient GPIO and memory.  
   - Must support the chosen RFID module’s interface (UART, SPI, I2C, etc.).

3. **Camera**  
   - USB or CSI camera (e.g., Raspberry Pi camera, standard USB webcam).  
   - High enough resolution for the detection task.

4. **Optional: GPU / Edge Device**  
   - For running more advanced or heavier AI models, consider using an NVIDIA Jetson board, Google Coral, or similar.

5. **Miscellaneous**  
   - Power supply, cables, and other connectors as required.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elabz/dcbot.git
   cd dcbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (for the software side):
   ```bash
   cd software
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
   - If using GPU acceleration, install CUDA/CuDNN drivers as needed (for TensorFlow/PyTorch).

3. **Configure the firmware**:
   - Navigate to the `firmware` directory.
   - Update any configuration files (e.g., `config.h`) with your microcontroller’s specifics (UART pins, SPI bus, etc.).
   - Use your preferred toolchain (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, Makefile, etc.) to build and flash the firmware onto the microcontroller.

4. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the RFID reader to the microcontroller following your hardware’s documentation.
   - Connect camera to your computer or development board (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
   - Provide proper power supply and ensure all voltages/grounds match.

---

## Usage

1. **Start Firmware**  
   - Once the firmware is flashed, ensure the microcontroller is powered on and the RFID reader is connected.

2. **Run the Software**  
   - Launch the main Python script:
     ```bash
     cd software
     python main.py
     ```
   - This script will:
     1. Initialize the AI model for computer vision.
     2. Listen for RFID tags from the microcontroller’s serial output (or any other configured interface).
     3. Perform object detection/classification on the camera feed.
     4. Fuse the data to identify tracked objects with associated RFID tags.

3. **Monitor Output**  
   - The console will display log messages about detected RFID tags, recognized objects, and any combined ID from data fusion.
   - Optionally, there may be a real-time video feed that draws bounding boxes and label overlays for recognized objects.

4. **Adjust Parameters**  
   - Tweak thresholds for confidence scores, RFID read intervals, or model hyperparameters in the configuration files (`config.py`, etc.).

## Data Collection & Training

If you need to retrain or customize the AI model for new objects:

1. **Capture Images**  
   - Use the camera to collect images of relevant objects (with and without RFID tags present).

2. **Label Images**  
   - Use a labeling tool (e.g., LabelImg) to annotate bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

3. **Train the Model**  
   - Use a training script (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train your object detection/classification model.
   - Export the trained model in a format compatible with the `vision_module`.

4. **Replace the Model**  
   - Place the newly trained model in the `ai_module` directory and update references in `detector.py` or `model.py`.
